# Job Market Paper
## Will tests lead to more informed antibiotics use? An application in veterinarian diagnostic decisions.
Draft and Abstract coming soon.

# Working paper
**Economics of the Veterinary Feed Directive**. **Yanan Jia**, Hongli Feng, and David A. Hennessy.

***Abstract*** This paper through a decision model of farmers’ disease management decision problem under uncertainty. In a suspected infection case, the farmer is uncertain about whether antibiotics will be effective, but can purchase certainty by way of a self-test or both certainty and reduced loss by way of a veterinary visit. Commencing 2017 the U.S. Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD), a command-and-control regulatory instrument, has mandated veterinarian oversight of medically important antibiotics administration in animal agriculture with intent to promote more informed antibiotics use and surveillance and likely reduce the amount used. Before VFD was implemented farmers chose whether to 1) administer without information, 2) call a veterinarian first, or 3) perform a self-test before doing either. Now the first is forbidden and a veterinarian must decide whether antibiotics are appropriate. We show that although VFD may reduce the farmer’s antibiotic demand (e.g., precautionary demand) it may not attain social optimum. Whether VFD resulting in excessive or insufficient antibiotic consumption depends on context. VFD may cause knock-on distortions in test market such as excessive demand for veterinary services. We also consider alternative incentive-based policies. Noteworthy is that the impact of self-test subsidies on antibiotic consumptions depends on antibiotic cost. Antibiotic demand decreases (increases) with a self-test subsidy given low (high) antibiotic cost. The context dependent effect of this subsidy arises because tests are information goods, where the consequences of more information vary in our analysis. For example, subsidies on the other information goods veterinary services unambiguously decrease antibiotic demand.

**Bt corn, insecticide use, and resistance time trends in the United States.** **Yanan Jia**, Hongli Feng, and David A. Hennessy.

***Abstract*** This project investigates the impact of biological control decisions in corn production on chemical insecticide use in the United States. Genetically engineered crops that produce Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) toxins can control some key pests and have been adopted widely. Specifically, Cry3Bb1 toxin was first commercialized in 2003 as an effective control for a key pest in maize in the United States. Using a unique dataset Agrotrak, we investigate how Cry3Bb1 toxin adoption can affect chemical insecticide use by adopters and non-adopters over years. The identification strategy is generalized difference-in-difference. The empirical results show that adopters substitute away from chemical insecticides which are targeted at corn rootworm. However, applied chemicals intended for rootworm on Cry3Bb1 corn gradually increases in the years after adoption. The upward trend in insecticide use is consistent with insect resistance development. For non-adopters, the amount of corn rootworm targeting insecticide use decreases as well, suggesting that non-adopters also benefited. This finding is consistent with the well-known conclusion in literature that Bt adoption brings a suppression effect on local pest population. Furthermore, insecticide use by non-adopters decreases over years and finally arrives at a plateau, suggesting that non-adopters learned slowly that there was less need for applied insecticides. The findings should be of interest to those concerned with the ecosystem services provided by insects, integrated pest management (IPM) regulators and practitioners, as well as others interested in the stewardship of biological resources.


**Do large dairy farms use more antibiotics?** **Yanan Jia**, Hongli Feng, and David A. Hennessy.
***Abstract*** Global milk production has undergone drastic change in recent years. Smaller farms have been under severe stress, squeezed between low milk prices and high feed prices. The resulting shakeout has led to high exit rates among smaller farms. However, overall production has expanded modestly as a few larger farms have taken advantage of scale economies to expand sharply. Animal agriculture sector structure is both very important and poorly understood as a factor in determining how the sector links with society at large, including consequences for One Health outcomes. In this project, we conducted a survey to ask about antibiotic usage patterns in three U.S. Great Lakes Region states (Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan) and explore how ongoing structural changes in the dairy sector affect the aggregate antibiotic use. Among farms which use antibiotics, the growing larger farms seem to be more efficient at antibiotic management. However, larger farms are less likely to be operated without antibiotics. Also, farms which have expanded in recent years or intend to expand in the near future, are more likely to use antibiotics for therapeutic purposes (i.e., non-organic farms). Therefore, to determine the aggregate effect of current structural changes in the dairy sector, future research is warranted.
