I am a PhD candidate in Department of Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics (AFRE) at Michigan State University (MSU). 

I am committed to a career in the broad area of policy analysis and prescription at the intersection between human behavior and biological risks. René Dubos, a microbiologist, environmentalist and prescient advocate of stewardship in biological control, once write “Nature always strikes back. It takes all the running we can do to remain in the same place.” As the confluence of biotechnology and information technology generates ever larger volumes of production information, the running in question often resolves to interpreting and using available information. How humans should use information to manage the biological commons in livestock and crop agriculture given nature’s redoubtable capacity to fight back is the underlying general theme in my Ph.D. dissertation.

Prior to enrolling at MSU, I received a BA degress in Economics and a MS degree in Finance from Peking University in 2015 and 2017. I am expected to graduate in 2022.
