Welcome!
I am a PhD Candidate in the Economics Department at Columbia University.
My fields of research are urban economics, international trade, development economics, and applied microeconomics in general.
I am on the job market and will be available for virtual interviews at the 2021 ASSA Meetings, and the 2020 European Job Market.

You can find my job market paper, as well as my other research [here](/research).
