I am a PhD candidate in Department of Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics (AFRE) at Michigan State University (MSU). 

I am committed to a career in the broad area of policy analysis and prescription at the intersection between human behavior and biological risks. Biological and chemical controls have been widely adopted to fight against bacteria in animal production and against insects in crop production. However, overuse of these controls places selective pressure on targeted populations to resolve resistance, thereby reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of these controls. My dissertation investigates individualsâ€™ decisions regarding biological or chemical controls in agricultural production under uncertainties. Information can remove or relieve uncertainties. The underlying general theme of my dissertation is how humans use information to make choices regarding biological or chemical controls.

Prior to enrolling at MSU, I received a BA degree in Economics and a MS degree in Finance from Peking University in 2015 and 2017, respectively. I am expected to graduate with a Ph.D. degree in 2022.
